# Proxy configuration
# If you want to change the ports on which openvidu listens, uncomment the following lines

# Allows any request to http://DOMAIN_OR_PUBLIC_IP:HTTP_PORT/ to be automatically
# redirected to https://DOMAIN_OR_PUBLIC_IP:HTTPS_PORT/.
# WARNING: the default port 80 cannot be changed during the first boot
# if you have chosen to deploy with the option CERTIFICATE_TYPE=letsencrypt
# HTTP_PORT=80

# Changes the port of all services exposed by OpenVidu.
# SDKs, REST clients and browsers will have to connect to this port

# Access restrictions
# In this section you will be able to restrict the IPs from which you can access to
# Openvidu API and the Administration Panel
# WARNING! If you touch this configuration you can lose access to the platform from some IPs.
# Use it carefully.

# This section limits access to the /dashboard (OpenVidu CE) and /inspector (OpenVidu Pro) pages.

# ALLOWED_ACCESS_TO_DASHBOARD=198.51.100.1 and ALLOWED_ACCESS_TO_DASHBOARD=198.51.100.0/24
# To limit multiple IPs or IP ranges, separate by commas like this:

# This section limits access to the Openvidu REST API.
